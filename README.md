(AIM: To avoid Angiogram test)

Objective: To predict the result of Angiogram test based on other tests result in order to avoid Angiogram test, which is very expensive.

Design: Used KFold model for cross validation. Used Random Forest classifier for predicting the outcomes on test data. Calculated accuracy by comparing predicted outcome and actual outcome. Selected high accuracy features. Used Decision Tree classifier for getting thresholds for the selected featur
